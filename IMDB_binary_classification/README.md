# Binary Classification with IMDB Dataset

From "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, p. 68-77

## Purpose
What should you learn:

### Workflow
* Binary classification with Keras
* Preprocess movie review data
* Predict if rating is positiv or negativ

### Thoughtful DL
* Object-oriented setup of the model
* Testing
    * Correct setup for Keras
    * Unit-testing components - _be aware_, this model is over-tested in a sense, that core functionalities of the underlaying framework is tested (which is an __anti-pattern__!)
    * Mocking method parameters
