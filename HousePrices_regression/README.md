# Regression Example with Boston Housing Price Dataset

From "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, p. 85-91

## Purpose
What should you learn:

### Workflow
* Regression analysis with Keras
* Imperative programming setup
* Plot performance metrices of model

### Thoughtful DL
* K-fold validation
* Make decisions about hyperparameter based on model performance plots
* Use mean absolute error to estimate performance of final model
