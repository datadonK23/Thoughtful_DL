# Multiclass Classification with Reuters Dataset

From "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, p. 78-84

## Purpose
What should you learn:

### Workflow
* Multiclass classification with Keras
* Preprocess Reuters newswire data
* Predict topics of newswires

### Thoughtful DL
* Plot history of trained model and choose epochs of final model thereby
* Evaluate performance of final model
    * Determine avoidable bias and variance
    * Choose tactics to tackle avoidable bias respectively variance
    * Set fixed constraints on performance metrices
