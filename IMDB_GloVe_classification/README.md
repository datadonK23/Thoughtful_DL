# Classification Example using Pretrained GloVe Embedding with IMDB Dataset

From "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, p. 189-193

## Dataset
Download [dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) into `/data` 
directory and uncompress it.

## Model
Download [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) into `/models` 
directory and uncompress it.

## Purpose
What should you learn:

### Workflow
* Functional workflow
* Processing raw data
* Using pretrained embedding (GloVe)
* Classification

### Thoughtful DL
* Functional setup, devide pipeline into functional parts for better testability
* Test tokenization of text data
* Test setting of trainability if layers
* Plot shape information of layers
* Model evaluation
